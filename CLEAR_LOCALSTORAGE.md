# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Clear localStorage to Fix Data Corruption

Your encrypted task data has been stored at the WRONG index in localStorage.

## Quick Fix

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Clear ALL localStorage
localStorage.clear();

// Reload page
location.reload();
```

## Root Cause

When creating an encrypted task, the code tries to guess which blockchain index was assigned by calling `blockchainTasks.length - 1`. This is unreliable because:
1. Other tasks might be deleted between creation and the `getTasks()` call
2. Network delays can cause timing issues
3. The actual blockchain index might be different

## What to Do After Clearing

1. **Delete all existing encrypted tasks** (they have wrong data)
2. **Create NEW encrypted tasks** with correct data
3. Your NEW encrypted tasks will store data correctly

The fix for the index determination issue has been applied, but existing tasks still have corrupted data in localStorage.
