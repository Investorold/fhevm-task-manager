# Clear Old localStorage Data

The "Invalid Date" and wrong data issue is caused by **old localStorage data** from before the ID fix.

## Quick Fix:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run this command:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

This will:
- âœ… Clear all old data
- âœ… Fix the ID mapping issue
- âœ… Allow you to create fresh tasks with correct data

---

## What Happened?

Your old tasks were saved with **timestamp IDs** (like `1735123456789`), but the new code looks them up using **blockchain array indices** (like `0`, `1`, `2`).

When the code tries to find task at index `0`, it looks for `localStorage.userTaskData[0]`, but finds nothing because your old data is stored at key `1735123456789`.

## After Clearing:

1. Refresh the page
2. Create NEW tasks (the old ones will be gone)
3. Your new tasks will have correct dates and priorities

---

**Your task data will persist correctly after this!** ðŸŽ‰
